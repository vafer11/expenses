# MyExps
A simple web application that allows you to manage and control your expenses. This application was built using:
- Clojurescript
- re-frame
- material-ui
- shadow-cljs
- firebase

## Features

MyExps allows you to create Expense Types, **that's just the name of the expense**... examples: Parking, Shopping, Rent, other.
Ones you created your Expense Types, you can start adding Expenses, just filling a simple form that requires the **Expense Type**, **Amount**, opcional **Note**, and **Date** of the expense.

You have the option to see expense's details and delete the last-six-month expenses.

You can also see the amount of money expensed by expense type.
